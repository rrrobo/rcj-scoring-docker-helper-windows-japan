## Download and run setup helper
#### **If git is not installed on your system, please install it first.

#### Download the setup helper
`git clone https://github.com/rrrobo/rcj-scoring-docker`

#### Start setup
`cd rcj-scoring-docker`
`sudo chmod +x *.sh`
`./setup.sh`
During execution, you may be asked to enter a password.

When complete, access http://localhost:3000 (http://IP address:3000 when accessing from another PC) and the system is already started and ready to use.

## Stop the system
Execute the following command in the setup helper directory (rcj-scoring-docker).
`./stop.sh`
During execution, you may be asked to enter a password.

## Resume the system
Execute the following command in the setup helper directory (rcj-scoring-docker).

## Restart the system
Execute the following command in the setup helper directory (rcj-scoring-docker).
`./restart.sh`
During execution, you may be asked to enter a password.

## Update the system
Execute the following command in the setup helper directory (rcj-scoring-docker).
When executed, the latest image is downloaded from Docker Hub and the container is replaced.
The data of the created tournaments and competitions will be retained.
`./update.sh`
During execution, you may be asked to enter a password.
Container replacement is performed even if there is no update.

## Change password of admin account
If you want to change the admin account password, edit the file `process.env` in the setup helper directory (rcj-scoring-docker) with a suitable editor.

```
# db vars see more at http://mongoosejs.com/docs/connections.html
DB_CONNECT_STR=mongodb://localhost/rcj-scoring

# web vars
WEB_HOSTPORT=3000

# log vars ERROR/INFO/DEBUG

# Account hardcoded

password=admin

# Default Account Setting
dUsername=admin
dPassword=adminpass       #CHANGE HERE
dAdmin=true
dSDAdmin=true
```

The change is applied by executing the following command in the setup helper directory (rcj-scoring-docker).
